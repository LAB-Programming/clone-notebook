##objectives:
####Tkinter GUI
  
i have created a Gui for clone-notebook that is user freindly but i am still working on makeing it better
like adding a drop down menu for the "save" insted of the button
    
####cration of notes

i have been able to create notes by saveing the notes in the file called "notebook.txt". every new note has a
tag infront of it: "<note>" which simblise that there is a note there so i can create a list using the python
libary re

####deletion of notes

so far i am trying to find out how to get rid of a note in both the text file "notebook.txt" and in the list
in my code so far i have made some progess i should be done soon

####editing of notes

right now if you clicked the save button after you edited a note than it would create a new note and note edit
the existing one. i am still work on it but being that it is low prioraty i am not going to deal with it just yet
